<h1>Understanding Undefined in JavaScript</h1>

<p>When dealing with code, it can be frustrating when an unexpected result appears out of nowhere. One of the most common cases of this is when you’re dealing with “undefined” in Javascript. But what exactly is undefined in Javascript, and what can you do about it? This article will cover the basics of understanding undefined in Javascript, and how to handle it when it occurs.</p>

<h2>What is Undefined?</h2>

<p>In Javascript, undefined is a keyword referring to a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value. When a variable is declared without being assigned a value, it will return undefined. This is different than a value being null, which means the variable has been explicitly assigned a value of null.</p>

<h2>Why Does Undefined Occur?</h2>

<p>Sometimes a variable will return undefined when you weren’t expecting it to because it was either never defined or it was defined but never assigned a value. This is due to the way Javascript hoists variables up to the top of the scope, meaning that if you declare a variable without assigning it a value, it will return undefined until you assign it a value. This is why it’s a good practice to always assign values to your variables when declaring them.</p>

<h2>How to Handle Undefined</h2>

<p>If you’re dealing with an issue where a variable is returning undefined, the best way to handle it is to check if the variable is defined and has a value before using it. This can be done with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && variable !== null) {
  //variable is defined and has a value
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Understanding undefined in Javascript is an important part of writing code. By understanding what undefined is and why it occurs, you’ll be able to properly handle it when it appears. The best way to handle undefined is to check if the variable is defined and has a value before using it.</p>
